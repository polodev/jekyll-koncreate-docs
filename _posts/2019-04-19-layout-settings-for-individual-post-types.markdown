You can override the above settings for individual post types. For any post types (like Posts, Project, Pages, Services, Team, etc), when you go to `Add New` or `Edit` page, you can find similar settings like above under the "Layout Settings" box. If you change any settings from here, this will take priority. If you choose default, settings from the `Theme Options > Layout Defaults` (described above) will be used.
