When you are ready to install a theme, you must first upload the theme files and then activate the theme itself. The theme files can be uploaded in two ways:

* **FTP Upload:** Using your FTP client, upload the non-zipped theme folder into the `/wp-content/themes/` folder on your server.
* **WordPress Upload:** Navigate to `Appearance > Themes > Add New > Upload`. Go to browse, and select the zipped theme folder. Hit "Install Now" and the theme will be uploaded and installed.

Once the theme is uploaded, you need to activate it. Go to `Appearance > Themes` and activate your chosen theme.

After that you need to install and activate the following pre-packaged plugins:

* **Koncreate Core:** Required and must install plugin.
* **RT Framework:** Required and must install plugin.
* **Redux Framework:** Required and must install plugin.
* **RT Demo Importer:** Required if you want to import demo contents. You can deactivate it after demo is imported.
* **Elementor:** Recommended. Page builder plugin.
* **Contact Form 7:** Optional. Install if you want to use contact form.

**N.B:** All plugins must be installed and activated if you want your site to look exactly like demo.   

To install these plugins, navigate to `Appearance -> Install Plugins` and start installation.
