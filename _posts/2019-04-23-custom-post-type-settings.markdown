We have created several custom post types eg. Team, Project, Service etc. You can change the slug (which is used as part of url) of these custom post types easily. To do this, go to `Appearance -> Theme Options`. Then go to `General` tab. Here you'll find these options:

<img alt="" src="{{ 'assets/images/koncreate_theme/cpt/cpt-1.jpg' | relative_url }}">

After changing the settings, Click on `Save Changes` button.
