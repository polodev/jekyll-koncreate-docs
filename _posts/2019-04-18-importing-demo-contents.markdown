Want to build your site like the demo? You can do it by only one click!

** Note: Before proceeding, please remember that when you are done with the demo import, all existing settings and contents will be removed and replaced by the demo contents. So it is highly recommended that you should only do this in fresh site.**

### 3.1 | Auto Import

First please make sure that Koncreate Parent Theme is activated on your site.

From Admin menu, navigate to `Tools > Demo Content Install`. Or alternatively,  navigate to `Plugins > RT Demo Importer > Install Demo Contents`.

It will take some time for importing the demo contents. *Please note: Some images are replaced with a placeholder image because of licensing.*

After importing demo data, please update your permalink. To update permalink, navigate to `Settings > Permalink` and then click on`Save Settings` button.
