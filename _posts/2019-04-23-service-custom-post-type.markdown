You can add a new Service from `Services` menu. For each `Service` you'll see the following settings:


<img alt="" src="{{ 'assets/images/koncrete_theme/cpt/service.jpg' | relative_url }}">


You can choose a Service Icon from right side



For displaying service in other page using Elementor, we have created Elementor elements for you.
From Elementor, Go to `RadiusTheme Elements` section and choose `Service Gallery` then choose your desired layout. You can alternatively search on Elementor search box with keyword `service`.
